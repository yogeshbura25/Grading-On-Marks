# Grading-On-Marks
This simple Python script calculates a student's total marks and assigns a corresponding grade based on the total marks achieved. It takes external and internal marks as input, sums them, and then determines the grade according to predefined grade boundaries. Here's how it works:
The user is prompted to enter their external and internal marks.
The total marks are calculated by adding external and internal marks together.
The program then evaluates the total marks against predefined grade boundaries and assigns a grade as follows:
A: Total marks greater than or equal to 75
B: Total marks greater than or equal to 65
C: Total marks greater than or equal to 55
D: Total marks greater than or equal to 45
E: Total marks greater than or equal to 35
F: Total marks less than 35
